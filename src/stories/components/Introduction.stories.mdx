# Introduction to the RB-Media Storybook

This Storybook was made to streamline and simplify the development process 
by supplying a varied component library from which developers can use templates to use in the project they are currently working on.

Every component is based on existing components and all CSS classes are written using the <a href="http://getbem.com/naming/" target="_blank">BEM</a> naming methodology so that they can be integrated as seamlessly as possible.

## How it works
On the left, there is a list of components. Each component has different variants called stories. 
Every story can be customized under the control tab in the bottom menu of the page. 
When you are finished with customizing your component you can head to the Html tab in the bottom menu and copy the necessary elements. 
Once you have implemented the needed elements into your project you can inspect the CSS in the code tab. 
This tab contains every CSS file used for that specific element. Copy the styling you need and add it to your project. 
After that, it's just a matter of checking if the styling was applied correctly and adjusting the elements to fit the current project.
